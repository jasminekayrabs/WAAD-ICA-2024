# Library Application Prototype Proposal

## Project Concept and Objective

This project aims to develop a web-based library application prototype to manage and browse a collection of books. It will support two user roles with distinct functionalities: Readers, who can browse the catalog, and authorized Librarians, who can manage the book entries. It uses JWT for authorization, Alpine.js for frontend and node.js for backend.

## User Types and Functionalities

### Readers (No Authentication Required)

- Browse books by genre, author, or title.

### Librarians (Authentication Required)

- Add, update, and delete book entries.

## Technical Overview

- **Backend:** Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** JWT
- **Frontend:** HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript with Alpine.js

## Preliminary Project Plan
